Bitnationâ€™s Pangea is a smartphone application intended to facilitate peer-to-peer governance and allow people to seize agency on their terms. Pangea can be used to create Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nations (DBVNs), become a Citizen of one or more DBVNs, provide goods and services to one or more DBVNs, enter into smart contract-based agreements via an encrypted chat interface, execute financial transactions via encrypted chat-based smart contracts, and accrue a monetized reputation.

Bitnation Pangea
================

Bitnation’s Pangea is a smartphone application intended to facilitate peer-to-peer governance and allow people to seize agency on their terms. Pangea can be used to create Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nations (DBVNs), become a Citizen of one or more DBVNs, provide goods and services to one or more DBVNs, enter into smart contract-based agreements via an encrypted chat interface, execute financial transactions via encrypted chat-based smart contracts, and accrue a monetized reputation.

Installation
============

-   Android
	Bitnation Pangea can be downloaded to Android devices from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.bitnation) by searching for ‘Bitnation’.

-   iOS
	The iOS version of Bitnation Pangea is currently available on Test Flight only. Use [this form](https://ios.bitnation.co/) on the Bitnation homepage to request an invitation to download Pangea via Test Flight.

Account Creation/Restoration
============================

-   Upon launching the app you will be presented with an option to either restore an account or create a new account.

-   The restore account option will prompt you to input a 24 word phrase previously created with the Pangea app.

-   The new account option will prompt you to name your account and then choose either a pin code or passphrase to secure it. You will then be taken to the Dashboard where you should immediately backup your new account’s 24 word phrase by writing it down and storing it in a safe location.

Nations
=======

 - Because creating and joining Nations are smart contract actions you
   will need to fund your account with a nominal amount of ETH in order
   to execute these actions.

Create Nation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-   Select the Nations tab on the lower menu bar on the Dashboard and then New in the upper right corner to create a Nation. Be careful to enter the desired parameters for your Nation correctly before submitting it to the blockchain. Upon selecting Submit on the lower menu bar you will be prompted to confirm that you’d like to continue with submitting your Nation. Upon continuing you will be prompted to set the gas price for the transaction before confirming. Be sure to use a high enough gas price or the transaction may not confirm.

Join Nation
^^^^^^^^^^^

-   Select the Nations tab on the lower menu bar on the Dashboard and browse the available Nations in order to find your desired Nation. Select your desired Nation and then select Join on the lower menu bar. You will be prompted to set the gas price for the transaction before confirming. Be sure to use a high enough gas price or the transaction may not confirm.

Encrypted Chat
==============

-   In order to use the encrypted chat you will need to select a Nation and then Chat from the lower menu bar. This will open up a chat interface where you can chat with other Citizens of the Nation you’ve selected.

-   Within the chat interface Citizens can create and enter into smart contract-based agreements with each other. These agreements can facilitate trustless financial transactions between Citizens and the parameters and context of these contracts can be augmented using decentralized applications (Dapps) within Pangea.

Pangea Dapp Languages
=====================

-   JavaScript

-   React Native

-   Solidity

Aspiring Dapp Developer Self-Teaching Protocol
==============================================

-   `A Better Way to Learn JavaScript <https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-JavaScript-technology-ebook/dp/B00H1W9I6C>`_ - an affordable and easy-to-follow book with exercises at the end of each short chapter for learning the basics of JavaScript.

-   Udemy offers affordable courses on `React Native <https://www.udemy.com/topic/react-native/>`_ and `Solidity <https://www.udemy.com/topic/solidity/>`_.

- These courses often take the form of brief video vignettes followed by exercises. The tools needed to perform the exercises are free, often made available through the Udemy courses, and easy to access.

Dapp Engine
===========

-   This is a selection of [template code](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/dapp-template) from which third-party developers can begin when building Pangea-ready Dapps for providing services and governance functionality to Citizens.

-   The Dapp engine provides public-facing access to the Pangea API.
  
-   Additional utilities can be found in the [Pangea tools repository](https://github.com/Bit-Nation/pangea-tools).

Example Dapp - Request for Qualifications (RFQ)
===============================================

-   This Dapp allows a Nation to publish a smart contract containing parameters of goods or services sought by the Nation to be auctioned to the lowest qualified bidder. The winning entity is bound to the terms of the RFQ which may include a variety of options for payment such as subscription, payment plans, etc.

-   This Dapp provides fundamental utility necessary for self-governance within Pangea.
